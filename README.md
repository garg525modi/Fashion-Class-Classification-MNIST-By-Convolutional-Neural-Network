## Fashion MNIST Clothing Classification By CNNs
1. [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more.
1. Top results are achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks with a classification accuracy of about 90% to 95% on the hold out test dataset.
1. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | hirt |
| 7 | Shirt |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |
